# Getting Started with Create React App

A reproducible demo to report absolute imports issue in react 18

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

There seems to be an issue with the way absolute imports are handled in the bootstraped project of `create-react-app` `v.5.0.1`

I have setted up absolute imports, according to the [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/importing-a-component/#absolute-imports) documentation

Some of the imports works, some of them don't ðŸ˜¢ and I can't figure out why

For example in `./src/App.ts`, the import of the `makeId` function imported from the `utils` folder makes the application crash, but the import of `FakeObjectType` from the `types` folder is compiled successfully

You will see the following error : `Module not found: Error: Can't resolve '@/utils' in ...`
